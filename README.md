# Decentralized Land Registration

Blockchain based Land Registration and transfer of entitlement system where the land ownership and all its details are stored in the Blockchain with zero chances of forgery in ownership.

## Challenges we faced
The main issue we encountered was figuring out how to integrate the truffle environment, which handles all of the blockchain-related backend, with the front-end react app. To interact with the smart contract via the front end, we used Web3.js. However, the documentation on Web3.js was insufficient for our needs. We were able to bridge the gap and make the app run smoothly with the help of some helpful blogs.
There were some difficulties in connecting Metamask to the local Ethereum network that we built. It took some time, but with the help of useful documentation from metamask, we were able to integrate the metamask authentication.

Tools used:
1. React.js used for front-end development.
2. Solidity used for back-end development.
3. Truffle and Web3.js
4. Ganache used as a local blockchain.
5. Metamask wallet.
